## Summary
As we come to the end of our analysis, we look forward to upcoming elections. As per the Colorado election committee, the use of this code can be used in further elections through the interchanging of .csv files with election data. It will be important that the data collected in the future follows the same formatting: 'Ballot ID', 'County', "Candidate'. If it does not match this format, adjustments to the code will be needed. The code present in Line 9 will also need to be updated to match the title of the new data being evaluated. Lastly, we suggest that the data be evaluated further, by determining the candidate's vote percentages per county as one more step in the audit.
