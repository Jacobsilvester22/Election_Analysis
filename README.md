1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of the percentage and total votes per district.
3. Determine which county had the most votes.
4. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
5. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.

## Summary
As we come to the end of our analysis, we look forward to upcoming elections. As per the Colorado election committee, the use of this code can be used in further elections through the interchanging of .csv files with election data. It will be important that the data collected in the future follows the same formatting: 'Ballot ID', 'County', "Candidate'. If it does not match this format, adjustments to the code will be needed. The code present in Line 9 will also need to be updated to match the title of the new data being evaluated. Lastly, we suggest that the data be evaluated further, by determining the candidate's vote percentages per county as one more step in the audit.
